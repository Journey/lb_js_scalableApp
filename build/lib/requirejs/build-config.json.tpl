/*
 * File: build-config.json.tpl
 * Template for the configuration of requireJS build process to
 * combine all scripts into a single script based on dependencies.
 *
 * The parameter names, between # signs, are replaced with actual values
 * to generate the build-config.json file in out/config folder by running
 * the Ant build process.
 *
 * The combined script is not minified at this step; it may be used in place
 * of the minified version for debugging purpose.
